1) Remove any hard-coded values, especially the room/pole bounds
2) Clean up the code by making the path_planner class single-vehicle specific
3) Need ability to stop all the vehicles at once if something bad happens,
	like one of the vehicles isn't tracking its trajectory properly
4) Need ability to asynchronously give commands, accounting for currently
	planned vehicle trajectories.
5) Implement velocity and jerk scaling 
	(currently we are only doing acceleration scaling)
